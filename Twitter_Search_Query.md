Ref. https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/rules-and-filtering/operators-by-product

(test1 OR test2 OR test3) -"ignore1" -"ignore2" -"ignore3" -"ignore4" -"ignore5"

=Ignore=
-keyword ã€€Not supported
(-keyword)    Not Function
(-"keyword")    Works Correctly

keyword1 OR keyword2     Not Supported
(keyword1 OR keyword2)  Most of case, function
("keyword1" OR "keyword2") Best as it seems

Still need to debug further as often got wrong result still.
And....Twitter change API spec often.
