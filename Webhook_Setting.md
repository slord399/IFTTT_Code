*Due to discord rate limit on IFTTT,replace domain to "webhook.lewisakura.moe" to avoid rate-limit.
(Do not spam relay, it is not allowed. Use with manor.)

*Due to fault on IFTTT action, LinkToTweet and/or Username method only works as it seems.

*If you want to make line break, use " \n " or " \r \n ".


{
  "username":"Name shown as username on discord",
  "icon_url":"https://abc.com/test_image_link.jpg",
  "content":"{{LinkToTweet}} "
}
